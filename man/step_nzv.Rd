\usage{
step_nzv(recipe, ..., role = NA, trained = FALSE, options = list(freq_cut
  = 95/5, unique_cut = 10), removals = NULL)

\method{tidy}{step_nzv}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables that will evaluated by the filtering. See
\code{\link[=selections]{selections()}} for more details. For the \code{tidy}
method, these are not currently used.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{options}{A list of options for the filter (see Details
below).}

\item{removals}{A character string that contains the names of
columns that should be removed. These values are not determined
until \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}} is called.}

\item{x}{A \code{step_nzv} object.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
\code{tidy} method, a tibble with columns \code{terms} which
is the columns that will be removed.
}
\description{
\code{step_nzv} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step
that will potentially remove variables that are highly sparse
and unbalanced.
}
\details{
This step diagnoses predictors that have one unique
value (i.e. are zero variance predictors) or predictors that are
have both of the following characteristics:
\enumerate{
\item they have very few unique values relative to the number
of samples and
\item the ratio of the frequency of the most common value to
the frequency of the second most common value is large.
}

For example, an example of near zero variance predictor is one
that, for 1000 samples, has two distinct values and 999 of them
are a single value.

To be flagged, first the frequency of the most prevalent value
over the second most frequent value (called the "frequency
ratio") must be above \code{freq_cut}. Secondly, the "percent of
unique values," the number of unique values divided by the total
number of samples (times 100), must also be below
\code{unique_cut}.

In the above example, the frequency ratio is 999 and the unique
value percentage is 0.0001.
