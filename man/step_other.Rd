\usage{
step_other(recipe, ..., role = NA, trained = FALSE, threshold = 0.05,
  other = "other", objects = NULL)

\method{tidy}{step_other}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables that will potentially be reduced. See
\code{\link[=selections]{selections()}} for more details. For the \code{tidy}
method, these are not currently used.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{threshold}{A single numeric value in (0, 1) for pooling.}

\item{other}{A single character value for the "other" category.}

\item{objects}{A list of objects that contain the information
to pool infrequent levels that is determined by
\code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}.}

\item{x}{A \code{step_other} object.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
\code{tidy} method, a tibble with columns \code{terms} (the
columns that will be affected) and \code{retained} (the factor
levels that were not pulled into "other")
}
\description{
\code{step_other} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe
step that will potentially pool infrequently occurring values
into an "other" category.
}
\details{
The overall proportion of the categories are computed. The "other"
category is used in place of any categorical levels whose individual
proportion in the training set is less than \code{threshold}.

If no pooling is done the data are unmodified (although character data may
be changed to factors based on the value of \code{stringsAsFactors} in
\code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}). Otherwise, a factor is always returned with
different factor levels.

If \code{threshold} is less than the largest category proportion, all levels
except for the most frequent are collapsed to the \code{other} level.

If the retained categories include the value of \code{other}, an error is
thrown. If \code{other} is in the list of discarded levels, no error
occurs.
